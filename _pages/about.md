I am a Senior year undergrad at Pune Institute of Computer Technology. My research interests lie in understanding how data, loss functions and activation functions affect the internal representations of machine learning models which in turn affects what a model learns and how it learns it. I am also interested in using computational methods for cognitive science and building cognition-aligned models. I am interested in applying machine learning to other domains such as computer systems, finance and industry 4.0.
