I am a Senior year undergrad at Pune Institute of Computer Technology. My research interests lie in understanding how data, loss functions and activation functions affect the internal geometry of machine learning models which in turn affects what a model learns and how it learns it. I am also interested in using computational methods for cognitive science and building cognition-aligned models. 

I have been fortunate to have the following academic/industry advisors up until now.
